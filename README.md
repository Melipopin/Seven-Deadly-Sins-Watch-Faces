Seven Deadly Sins Watch Faces for Your wearOS Watch

### **To install watch faces on your wear OS watch, you need:**
> - watch with wearOS 2.0 and higher
> - Windows PC

## How to install

### 1. Activate ADB debuging
The only interface that allows us to manage the watch more flexibly is only ADB via Wi-Fi, so we need to activate it in the watch settings.

Open the settings on your watch and go to **"About watch"** -> **"Software info"**.

<br/>
<br/>

Find **"Software version"** and tap on it until you get the message **"Developer mode turned on"**.

Now, among the settings items, the **"Developer Settings"** item has appeared.

<br/>
<br/>

Go to **"Developer Settings"** and enable **"ADB Debugging"** and **"Debug over Wi-Fi"**.

Wait until the watch shows its own IP address to connect.

**Excellent. Your watch is ready to connect to your PC and install watch faces.**

### 2. Installing watch faces

> In order for a computer to connect to your watch, it must be connected to the same Wi-Fi network.

[**Download**](https://codeload.github.com/Melipopin/Seven-Deadly-Sins-Watch-Faces/zip/refs/heads/main) the archive with the installer and watch faces if you haven't done it before. Copy the folder from the archive to any place convenient for you.

Run the file **install.bat**.

<br/>
<br/>

Enter the **IP address** you received from the watch in the developer options and press enter.

If you did everything right and entered the IP address correctly, you will see a message on the command line that the connection to the watch was successful, and a screen with the question "Allow Debugging?" will appear on the watch. In the pop-up window, click "Always allow from this computer".

To start installing watch faces, simply press enter again.
At the end of the installation, the installation window closes automatically.
